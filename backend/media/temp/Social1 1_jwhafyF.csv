question
"Back again with a new spiral. On Friday I started getting an unrelenting overall headache not a migraine but persistent. Some nausea that eventually turned into stabby pains in my stomach. I can’t take Advil due to stomach issues. Tylenol would help take the pain away then wear off. Same time my next is super stiff. I used a posture corrector last week and I think it messed up my neck. Muscles feel like rocks. So I borrow my friends neck massager, tried some stretches and got an actual neck massage today. It really helped my headache however my stomach is now having this “dropping” feeling - you know that feeling when you peer over the edge of a cliff or almost get side swiped on a highway? It’s like my flight or fight system is activated. I’m worried my neck is trapping my vagus nerve. Is this possible? Am I going to be okay? This constant stomach drop is so anxiety provoking."
"Hi! Thank you for your detailed and helpful reply. I actually am familiar with Dr. Horowitz, SA, and used one of his papers and the UK guidelines during my own taper but still likely did it too fast. I had the sort of naive ‘that couldn’t happen to me’ attitude and here we are. *sigh*. I didn’t put it in this post but I did reinstate a few weeks ago at 0.4 mg and have had slight improvement since (able to sleep at night, don’t have a headache 100% of the time though I get them pretty much daily). I have been contemplating increasing more but honestly am so terrified to do anything or make any changes due to all I’ve been through. I work nights and haven’t been able to sleep during the day because my anxiety seems to surge more during the daytime so I am really feeling quite stuck because I’m not going to be able to sustain essentially pulling 3 all nighters per week for much longer and it certainly isn’t helping my mental health to do so. I find forums like Reddit and SA pretty triggering due to all of the bad stories so I’ve been trying to avoid them. At this point 8 wouldn’t even mind being back on celexa if I could get my life back. I miss my old self so much. As far as migraine medication goes nurtec is relatively new but I haven’t noticed it affecting my anxiety as of yet. Triptans definitely heighten it so I try to avoid those. I’m off caffeine and avoid OTC meds due to rebound headaches. Now I just need to decide if I want to go up more from the 0.4 mg or stay there."
"OP did you end up heading over to the ER? I would recommend asking the technician to reposition the device ever so slightly differently the next time you go in (tomorrow?). They shouldn’t be guessing! 😖 It’s definitely painful, but a headache or migraine shouldn’t persist. I would definitely recommend eating pretty soon after treatment and take an excedrin with your snack or meal! Is the pilot at a TMS office and are the technicians trained? I’m questioning whether they’re qualified if they’re not super confident about the placement of the device. 😞"

"INFUSION DAY 💃🏼 It took a couple of weeks for the first infusion to work but my late spring/early fall was WONDERFUL and I hardly had to use my rescue meds. I saw improvement on ALL migraine types/triggers that I have (hormonal, weather related, tention, ocular, vestibular) and way less vertigo overall! #migraine #migrainerelief #migrainetiktok #migraineinfusion #vyepti #vyeptiinfusion #migrainemedicine #migraineawareness #ocularmigraine #vestibularmigraine "
"It wasn’t something he’d verbally said, but still communicated clearly. We’d only known each other a few days but he dry swallowed a pill I said would help his migraine just because I said trust me. That’s gonna rattle around my brain forever."
"So I need recommendations on neurologists that can continue my migraine medication from out of state ASAP. I'm out of my ""last ditch"" abortive migraine meds and I'm terrified of what life will be like without them. I have already called around, but all the neurologists I've called don't have an appointment until next year. But I don't need a full physical appointment, I just need an appointment to renew the prescriptions I've already been prescribed from out of state by another neurologist. Or at least something to bridge the gap between seeing the neurologist. I have already been diagnosed and already been prescribed this medication. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions or recommendations? Also, my insurance runs out today, but I am willing to pay cash as long as it can renew my prescription and not a start from zero diagnostic appointment."
"I understand your frustration. Toradol can provide quick relief, but it's often temporary. When it wears off, the migraine may return if the underlying cause isn't addressed. This highlights the importance of tackling the root causes of migraines, not just treating symptoms. Have you considered exploring metabolic approaches? Things like diet optimization and supporting energy metabolism can make a big difference long-term. I'd be happy to share some resources on these approaches if you're interested. Don't lose hope - there are always new strategies to try in managing migraine."
"Changing my career has helped massively with reducing my work stress as I'm now full time wfh which is awesome for migraine management. I still have anxiety and rumination, possibly some ocd, I'm still figuring it out. What's helped is exercising and learning how to express my needs in a less reactive and more proactive way. Also magic mushrooms kill my anxiety for a few weeks."
"Melatonin helps you be sleepy but it isn't going to force you to sleep. Advil also won't help a migraine that is from lack of sleep, only sleep will help. Do you know why you aren't sleeping? Something happened? Is this common for you?"
"I have come across doctor's that don't pay attention. I used to be on prozac and my pcp gave me some migraine meds while in her office, despite me telling her it's not a normal migraine, it's a sinus migraine. I've had them since I was 8 years old. Well the migraine med mixed with the prozac and gave me a reaction. I felt paralyzed. I called the pharmacy because I couldn't remember what she gave me and she sent in a script. The pharmacist asks if I'm on prozac still and I said yes. He said those 2 meds can't be taken together. She knew I was on prozac because she upped my dosage at the same time she handed me the migraine meds. I never went back. This surgeon prescribed me some prilosec and the nurse tried to give me some. I now always ask what I'm taking and why. I said I can't have that because I'm on celexa and if they mix, I cannot stay awake. She said she would talk to the surgeon. She came back and said my pepcid ac meds would be ok to take. Didn't matter to me cuse I know what prilosec does to me, and I was not going to take it. I'm sorry you're going thru this. You mentioned that he said unless your concerns are in his charts, it doesn't matter. Are your concerns in there now? Because it does matter. What if your concern of an allergy isn't in there and ""doesn't matter"". He could hurt you or worse. If he's not concerned for your wellbeing, I don't think he's the surgeon for you."

"Only got 5 hours of sleep and woke up with severe migraine and sweating. It has wiped me out fot the rest of the day... and still going. I took note of how much I did to manage it: - Took abortive immediately. Took a different med later when this didn't work. - Drank water consistently throughout the day - Went through Mcdonalds drivethrough across the road - to get salty chips & OJ. - Made and ate regular snacks (didn't have energy to cook) - Pulled all the curtains down - Took vitamins - Set up my comfort area. This took more energy than I had - as the migraine sapped most of it. I've still got to the evening to survive... In summary, I decided I am working today because I am managing migraine👷‍♀️. Chronic migraine is a full time job !"

"Tbh I like the smell of clean. Not cologne. I think that's part of why I was drawn to my spouse. They only smelled like...a person. Like I could catch a faint whiff of their bar soap and deodorant and that was it. Cologne and perfume literally make me sick (allergic! Sneeze inducing, asthma inducing, migraine inducing) so no I'm not attracted to those smells at all."

"I’ve been experiencing headaches and migraines now almost daily for 2.5 years. I finally went to the neurologist and he basically said “you have tension headaches” and masked it by prescribing medication. The medication isn’t working. I feel as if something else is truly wrong. I’m planning to get a second opinion. BUT, I also have recently developed neck pain whenever I get a migraine / headache. I mentioned it, and he said “that has nothing to do with your headache.” I really truly didn’t feel heard. I have never had an MRI, and I think I should get one, but the neurologist said it was “unnecessary, as it won’t show anything.” I have anxiety thinking about the possibility of a brain tumor? Am I stupid for thinking I have one? Idk! I need help from you guys! Has anyone had a similar experience with bad headaches and migraines with neck pain? If so, what could this be? I have also experienced multiple episodes of Deja vu (things that never even happened, but I get a feeling that I have been somewhere / done a specific thing) My migraines seem to normally be on the right side, and the neck pain is on the right as well, but there are times where I get a migraine on the left… Thank you🙏🏼🙏🏼"

"She had THC in her system, I wonder how much. If it was trace amounts by the time she died, possibly Monday, how much was in her body when she ended up in the basement Saturday night? Enough to get the spins? Accident seems unlikely but I guess I could see it. She's got a crazy migraine, gets super high to manage it. The dog starts barking, maybe someone is in the backyard. Her head is just pounding, she's trying to hold it together on the phone. She drops the phone, staggers, trips over the dogs and goes head first into the piggy bank. Now she's bleeding profusely, hurt, confused, still tripping on the basement floor. The animals come to the top of the stairs to check on her but she screams at them to stay up there so they don't make a mess in the blood. I have a chocolate lab who will absolutely follow this for all of about an hour if there's been a spill or glass on the floor. But maybe she's semi conscious and repeating it frequently. The pants falling down, the random doors and palm prints, all that random unexplainable evidence could be explained but the fact that she was very high basically until blood loss cause it's own kind of delirium. Honestly, this reminds me a bit of the Rebecca Zahau case with the complete and total lack of evidence of outside party involvement. How can that even be possible"
Yes it’s normal and most medications are covered. If they aren’t your family Dr can fill out the exceptional access program form and try and have the medication covered that way. I have a migraine script that had to be covered that way or else I was paying $80 out of pocket for 6 pills.
">Cylcobenraprene Presuming you meant Cyclobenzaprine, because that's what I am prescribed and have been on for years. This is not a headache / migraine treatment or preventative exactly. It is a muscle relaxant. That may not be suitable or relevant for a lot of people with migraine. In my case it sort of looks like: Injury > neurological damage > muscle spasms / knots (and insomnia) > migraines. In other words, for me, treating the muscle spasms(with meds and basically not working/laboring to incurr more muscle problems) reduces migraine frequency and severity. The side effect of drowsiness can be pretty severe, especially if I take at full prescription(3x daily, 10mg I think), but that's perfect, because I also have insomnia and getting tired a lot helps me get enough sleep. In cases where I still get a 10/10, I have ""the big pill"" Fioricet, I think (bottles always say ""butalbital"", which is also listed as an ingredient, so there's a weird circular thing when you try to look it up....but anyways) >Fioricet capsules contain a combination of acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine. Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and fever reducer. Butalbital is in a group of drugs called barbiturates. It relaxes muscle contractions involved in a tension headache. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It relaxes muscle contractions in blood vessels to improve blood flow. This usually cracks the bad ones, though it can take a few hours. Possibly because they basically have to be taken with food or they tear my stomach up really bad, I think it eats right through the lining when empty. I only ever take one, I took two once, as per ""every 4 hours as needed""....never again, stomach pain for days. There are variations with aspirin instead of tylenol, and apparently even some with codeine. Never had those. A 4-way attack on the tension and migraine headache might be nice, but eh, when you ask too hard about this stuff you run the risk of looking like a drug seeker. At that, I have a scrip for like 15 of ""the big pills"" which, if I'm lucky, I fill once every 6 months because the rest keep me out of the range where there're necessary. Still chronic daily, but managing at 3 to 5 most of the time two 8's a week, instead of 4 to 8 and one or two 10's a week."
"Okay, so they were texting constantly, all of a sudden the line disconnects during their call right after him hearing the dog whining and somehow he was not worried sick? How van you go from being in constant contact to zero calls/texts without being super worried. He thought she was with her family but somehow doesn't double check with any of her family members? My humble opinion is that it could be a stranger coming in through the backdoor, pushing her down the stairs (do we now if anything got stolen?) and roaming around for a little bit, leaving her downstairs waiting for them to be gone. I don't know what type of medication she was on for her migraine but maybe some of it could have had something blood thinning in it making it so her bleeding did not stop. In the end she had lost so much blood it was maybe too hard for her to physically move so she passed out and died in the basement? I am not that stuck on the dogs not going downstairs if the intruder(s) were inside for quite some time and her being passed out by the time they were gone - the dogs not being able to hear her anymore so there was no reason for them to go downstairs. I am honestly baffled by this case but also, if I were her husband and I had nothing to do with it, I would never forgive myself for not driving home the evening of the disconnected phone call. She would probably have still been alive at that point, accident or not."
"“Safe” when talking about triptans, to me, is a relative term. Is it safe? Clinically yes. Does is say you could literally die while taking it? Yes- but you haven’t, so you’re probably in the safe realm. Just remember, adding triptans means that if you take any OTC meds, you can only medicate 9 days a month with one or both or all of the medications, or risk contracting MOH, a secondary migraine disorder that makes your primary disorder more severe and chronic. Triptans + OTC meds gave me MOH which gave me 20-30 migraines a month. Now that I’ve treated my MOH, I don’t touch Triptans and frankly don’t really consider otc meds “safe” either."
"Try Delta 8. I use D8 edibles for my migraines that are 30mg squares, about the same size as a Starburst, and I usually take about 1/4 of those when the migraine isn't too bad and it goes away. For stress management I use THC-A cartridge, but for a long time I used D8, which I liked because I could smoke it nearly anywhere (even at work if things started to get stressful) and I never felt anywhere near as high as normal THC products made me feel. Difference I think is just that D8 is derived from hemp and not marijuana."
Mine was terrible the first week. So bad I couldn’t open my left eye and considered the er. Amazon a migraine cap. They go in your freezer and are amazing. I took excedrin as soon as I got out of the office. Try to drink. I have been drinking pedialyte and water. Dark room and rest. Mine have gotten better I’m on week 2 it’s more bearable now
"To me this sounds like postdrome though, since you started with a migraine and then developed these symptoms, all of which are typical for postdromes from what I know. I also get postdrome and they feel different than acute VM. My postdromes have flu-like body aches, difficulty concentrating, lingering phonophobia, fatigue, and general malaise. When I have the migraine it feels like there’s a wall in my head blocking my ability to think/read/talk, vs postdrome my mind feels totally empty."
"Ever heard that migraines are """"just from stress""""? 🤔 Let’s set the record straight! While stress can indeed be a trigger, migraines are way more than that. They’re a complex neurological condition with a whole mix of possible triggers—like certain foods, changes in sleep, or even weather changes! #migrainerelief #migraine #migrainerelieftok #migraines #migraineawareness #migrainetips #migrainesociety #migraineremedies #headache #headacherelief #headacheseveryday #headachehat #headachehacks #StressRelief #stressfree #soothie #soothiehoodie #soothierelief "
Didn’t really feel any pain when I woke up. The nausea and a migraine headache were worse than surgical pain. To be honest the gas pain was more strong than surgical pain too. I’m day 8 or 9 post op. Have been only on Tylenol and or Advil. Anything stronger will constipate you . It gets better . The hospital team really do good at keeping the surgical pain minimal .

"Mine looked almost exactly like yours and I just got them out a little over a week ago. Similar to you, they’d only cause pain every once in a while but the pain would go away after about a week so I left them alone because I was terrified of oral surgery. The Monday before I got them taken out, I out of nowhere woke up multiple times in the middle of the night with excruciating pain. I have a high pain tolerance but by the time morning came, I could barely swallow, it hurt badly to talk, and I was in tears. I had to call off work and get an emergency appointment set a couple days later to get them removed. I was icing my cheeks and taking ibuprofen every six hours all week until then, with a migraine that just never left. It was so bad that if I could’ve ripped the teeth out of my jaw myself, I would have! Turns out my bottom one that was leaning almost sideways got infected which is why it hurt so badly. All that to say, it’s better to get them done now than later when it’s an emergency. :("

"Have you tried high dose NSAID like naproxen 1000mg as a rescue med? Lamotrigine at 200mg to 300mg cut my aura and migraine phases right back to milder episodes of pins and needles/tingling/stinging, a slight drool/face droop and headach. Have not had a blind eye for over 6 years. It was the only drug that worked like this and has minimal side-effects. It also stopped the short absence seizure type activity that started and was finally the last straw to make me try it. In recent years, I added pregabalin for another condition and found that alongside lamotrigine I got even more resolution of the migraines and aura. Sometimes I took nortriptyline as well but started to worry too much about polypharmacy. If I stop lamotrigine (lamictal brand) my face droop and trigeminal nerve pain returns, then everything else. The aura became persistant after having status migranosus for more than 2 years. I still use naproxen for a classic migraine head pain if they occur."
"@lilbitttybatty Have you tried Excedrin Extra Strength or Excedrin migraine? Try that (if you can) it should help.  Hang in there, it's 2:15 already. Hope you feel better soon.🙏"
"Quick background: I'm 36M, had TBI when I was 8 years old. I can't go out without atlius tinted contact lenses, tinted glasses, clip-on sunglasses, and a hat, whether it's day or night. Botox seems to be the only thing that works for me, but after 3 years, it only works for about a month and a half. The other month and a half, I'm on average 2 or 3 out of 10, I can go a week without leaving the house, and I can't even go to my mailbox. I've tried numerous products that might help, and I'd say about 95% of them were failures. My wife told me about a product she saw on Instagram called ZOK Instant Migraine Relief. I hesitated to try it because most of these are posted to get a free product, and they sure don't post the negative ones. However, I decided to give it a try. I experienced great relief when I applied negative pressure to my left ear. It made me wonder if it could be related to vertigo, as neurologists never mentioned it. So, last week looked into the vertigo Epley maneuver., I went from being miserable 2/10 to 8/10 in just 4 minutes, and I had a fantastic day, which is not something I'm accustomed to. I kept doing it for the next few days, about 4-5 times a day, and half somersault maneuver, every time it gave me 1 hour or 2 of relief, which was great, but after that I went back to the dizziness; I kept doing the manoeuvers until yesterday I barely saw a difference, today too, the relief was still there but minimal. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing here. I got very excited for a few days, but now I'm back to feeling like nothing can help."
